1. Network up (2-org test network)
    Brought up Fabric with CAs and created channel forensic-chainguard:
    Command: ./network.sh up createChannel -c forensic-chainguard -ca
2. Chaincode project prepared (small footprint)
    Created a minimal chaincode/ folder at the repo root containing only:
        dist/ (compiled JS from your TypeScript)
        package.json (+ package-lock.json)
    This avoided packaging node_modules/, fabric-samples/, docs, old tarballs, etc.
3. Deployed chaincode (Node/TypeScript)
   Command: ./network.sh deployCC \
                        -c forensic-chainguard \
                        -ccn chainguard \
                        -ccp /Users/ashishnc/Desktop/blockchain-cse540/cse540-forensic-chainguard/chaincode \
                        -ccl javascript \
                        -ccv 1.4 \
                        -ccs 1
    Result: 1. Packaged the chaincode (chainguard_1.4: efdfffd7...a6de).
            2. Installed on peer0.org1 and peer0.org2.
            3. Approved the definition for Org1MSP and Org2MSP (sequence 1, version 1.4).
            4. Commit readiness showed both orgs true.
            5. Committed definition to channel forensic-chainguard.
            6. Query confirmed: Version: 1.4, Sequence: 1, approvals from Org1MSP & Org2MSP.
